README for Course Project of Getting and Cleaning Data
-------------------------------------------------------

The R script run_analysis.R in this repo is the script for the course project assignment.

The script is to be run in RStudio. The paths that store the data files needed for this project
need to be stored in the mentioned location relative to this script. An easy way to do this is
to ensure that your R working directory is set to where this script is locally and keep the 
data files under this dir.

Codebook.md describes the variables used in this script.

The output of this script is stored in a file that gets generated and is called "tidydata.txt".
